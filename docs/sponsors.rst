Sponsorship Information
-----------------------

As part of increasing sustainability, 
Read the Docs is testing out several spots for promoting sponsors on documentation pages. 

We have more information about this in our `blog post <https://blog.readthedocs.com/ads-on-read-the-docs/>`_ about this effort.

Doc Page Promotion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This promotion is our best offering, it will display on the bottom of the
navigation menu on all built documentation.  This space includes a 120x90 image
and supporting ad text on every documentation page using the Read the Docs
theme, which is over 20,000,000 pageviews every month.

User experience on documentation pages is paramount, and any sponsored ads are
strictly image and text -- no dynamic components, animations, or tracking pixels
are allowed. This space will not interfere with the navigation menu, and will
only show if the menu is short enough, or the reader has scrolled down on the
page past the end of the menu.  This promotion is not displayed for users with
gold status, or users that have donated in the past.

`Contact us`_ for more specifications on this promotion spot.

Footer Logo Promotion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This promotion displays the name of your company in the footer of documentation pages.
It is a rotation of all sponsors,
so will vary in pageviews based on the number of supporting companies.
We will never have more than *10* companies in this promotion at any time.
